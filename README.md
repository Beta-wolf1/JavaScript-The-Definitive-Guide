This project is an extension of **JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David flanagan**. 

Each `.md` files contain questions about a particular chapter of the textbook. Questions are often based on the current chapter including the previous ones. But no unread chapter will be included. 

The exercises are meant to solidify your knowledge of the JavaScript language, understanding its syntax and especially, **critical thinking** and **paying attention to details**. 

## HOW TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

Each .md file usually contain two types of questions
- Thought questions
- Code problems

To answer each exercise, create a new folder. In that folder, create two new files, one `.md` and `.js` file. The thought questions are to be answered in the `.md` file while the code questions are to be solved in the `.js` file. This is preferable so as to remove unnecessary comments from the JavaScript code and to allow clarity of ideas. Feel free to corroborate your answers with google search results, nice markdown formats, images, and further suggestions. **Thank you**
